# Car Sharing Platform — Distributed Microservices Backend System

A distributed backend platform for a car sharing service that allows users to list vehicles, search available cars, and manage bookings.

The system is built using a **microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud**, integrating service discovery, distributed tracing, centralized logging, monitoring, caching, and asynchronous messaging.
The entire environment can be started using **Docker Compose**, simulating a production-style backend infrastructure.

---

## System Architecture

The platform is composed of multiple microservices communicating via REST APIs and asynchronous messaging.

### Core Services

* **API Gateway** – single entry point for client requests and routing
* **User Service** – user management and authentication
* **Car Service** – car catalog management and search
* **Booking Service** – reservation and booking logic
* **Dispute Service** – dispute resolution between renters and owners

### Service Discovery

* **Eureka Server** – service registry and discovery

### Messaging

* **Kafka** – asynchronous communication between services

### Data Layer

* **PostgreSQL** – primary relational database
* **Redis** – caching layer

### Observability Stack

* **Prometheus** – metrics collection
* **Grafana** – metrics visualization dashboards
* **Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (ELK)** – centralized logging
* **Zipkin** – distributed tracing across microservices

### Containerization

* **Docker**
* **Docker Compose**

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

* Java 17
* Maven
* Docker
* Docker Compose

---

### Clone the repository

mvn clean package
```

### Start the infrastructure and services

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Business Flows

### Booking lifecycle

1. **Create booking** — Client sends `POST /api/v1/bookings` with renter, car, time range and pickup location. Booking Service validates that the user exists (User Service), the car is available (Car Service), and **no other active booking overlaps the same car and time**; then creates a booking in status `PENDING`.
2. **Approve** — `PATCH /api/v1/bookings/{id}` with `{"status": "APPROVED"}` moves the booking from `PENDING` to `APPROVED`.
3. **Complete** — Same endpoint with `{"status": "COMPLETED"}` moves from `APPROVED` to `COMPLETED`. **A completed payment is required** for the booking before it can be completed.
4. **Cancel** — `{"status": "CANCELED"}` is allowed from `PENDING` or `APPROVED`; completed bookings cannot be canceled.

### Payment flow

1. **Create payment** — For an existing booking, `POST /api/v1/bookings/{bookingId}/payment` creates a payment (method, status `PENDING`). The **amount is calculated inside Booking Service** using:
   * base price derived from booking duration,
   * dynamic pricing rules (time-of-day and pickup location multipliers),
   * optional promo code discounts,
   * optional loyalty points redemption.
2. **Confirm** — `PATCH /api/v1/admin/payments/{paymentId}/confirm` sets payment to `COMPLETED`. At this moment, the renter **earns loyalty points** based on the paid amount.
3. **Refund** — `PATCH /api/v1/admin/payments/{paymentId}/refund` is allowed only for `COMPLETED` payments. (Loyalty adjustments for refunds can be extended in future iterations.)

### Security and roles via API Gateway

* All secured requests pass through the API Gateway, where JWT tokens are validated.
* After successful validation, the gateway forwards user identity and roles to downstream services via headers:
  * `X-User-Id` — numeric user identifier from the `userId` claim.
  * `X-User-Roles` — comma-separated list of roles from the `authorities` claim (for example `ROLE_USER,ROLE_ADMIN`).
* Endpoints under `/api/v1/admin/**` are additionally protected at the gateway level and require the `ROLE_ADMIN` authority. Requests without this role receive `403 FORBIDDEN` before reaching downstream services.

## Tests and coverage

All tests are integration-style: they use the Spring context, in-memory H2 where applicable, and mock external calls where needed.

**Run all tests** (from project root; builds all modules and runs tests):

```bash
mvn test
```

**Run tests for a single module** (build dependencies first, or use `-am`):

```bash
mvn test -pl booking-service -am
mvn test -pl api-gateway -am
```

If you already ran `mvn install` from the root, you can use `mvn test -pl booking-service` without `-am`.

**Run a specific test class:**

```bash
mvn test -pl booking-service -Dtest=BookingControllerIntegrationTest
```

**Generate JaCoCo coverage report** (for modules that define the JaCoCo plugin):

```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

Reports are written under `target/site/jacoco/index.html` in each module.

* **Prometheus** collects metrics from microservices
* **Grafana** visualizes system performance dashboards
* **Logstash** collects and processes application logs
* **Elasticsearch** stores and indexes logs
* **Kibana** provides log visualization
* **Zipkin** enables distributed tracing across services

This setup allows monitoring request flows, system health, and service performance.
